I don't think that there's a single answer to this. Nothing makes sense until a mind makes it so.

You basically have to project a purpose. And if you zoom out far enough, there's the heat death of the universe and everything is meaningless. Everything is just a blip in between. And the question is, do you find meaning in this blip, in between, do you find meaning in observing squirrels, do you find meaning in raising children and projecting a multi-generational organism into the future, do you find meaning in projecting an aesthetic of the world that you would like see to the future and trying to serve that aesthetic? And if you do, then life has that meaning. And if you don't, then it doesn't.
